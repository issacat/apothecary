PLACES

Tarandus Highland Taiga
	{ethereal bilberry, torched perunika}
	The snow-covered forests of mystery and frequent storms, where things are not as they seem and <b>lightning visits in romance</b>. Yet, all is <b>quiet</b>, and one becomes one with the world.


Yashil Boreal Forest
	{dwarf bilberry, blooming fern}
	Secrets are hidden within the forest's depths, things <b>sweet</b> and <b>fortitious</b>. Yet, care must be made with what is taken from its domain. You are never sure of what you see.


Siyohrang Planregenmoore (Coastal Bog)
	{bog billberry, violet perunika}
	The water runs brown and thick, and its soil is of a deep red-purple hue. The plants of this coastal bog take the colour of the soil, and are both <b>hauntingly beautiful</b> yet <b>dangerously poisonous</b>.


The Yellow Ranges
	{tormented fern, midnight fern}
	The mountains glow yellow in the evening and morning light - a strange and beautiful view. At the foot, <b>plants do not bloom</b>, but remain in frustrated silence. In the night, <b>lights can be seen twinkling</b>, but where they come from... it isn't known.


Tenger Gardinur
	{divine perunika, midnight fern}
	On the vast ice flats of this cold desert, the curtains of heaven dance every night. It is a <b>sacred place</b> where one travels between worlds, and the <b>night is lit</b>. One often travels here for a <b>sanctified solitude</b>.
